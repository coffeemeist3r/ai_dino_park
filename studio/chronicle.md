# Chronicle

Append-only human-readable log of every routine fire. Read top-to-bottom to see what the studio has been doing.

Each entry: `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — cycle NNN — <routine> — <verdict or summary>`

## 2026-05-25 — cycle 000 — bootstrap

The watcher (human) instructed Claude to scaffold the project. Stack: Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite, WebLLM-powered NPC brains (Qwen2.5), Capacitor mobile path deferred.

Bootstrap shipped:
- Git repo initialized (local; GitHub push pending — gh CLI not installed on host).
- CHARTER.md (constitution), BACKLOG.md (40 seed items), STYLE-GUIDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, README.md.
- Game scaffold: one walkable map, one talking dino (Rex the triceratops) with stub brain. Press Z to greet.
- 7 routine prompt templates.
- Cron schedule: ~one full cycle every 36 hours, staggered Mon–Wed. Tuned for Claude Pro plan.
- Tests scaffold (Vitest unit + Playwright e2e).
- CI workflow (GitHub Actions).

Studio armed and waiting for first scheduled fire of Lore-smith.

## 2026-05-25 — cycle 001 — lore-smith — seeded

Smoke-test fire of Lore-smith by the bootstrap session. Bumped cycle 0 → 1. Closed BACKLOG-001..004 (shipped at bootstrap). Added five fresh items (041–045) leaning into emergence: sleeping huddles, eggs, personality drift, lost-item folklore, catchphrase emergence. Suggested next-up to Designer: BACKLOG-007 (world tick clock) — small foundation, unblocks the most downstream BACKLOG.

State advanced to `phase: designer-pending`. Next scheduled fire: Designer, Mon 10:20 PT next week. Coder is scheduled tonight at 18:46 PT but will see `phase != coder-pending` and politely no-op.

## 2026-05-25 18:46 — cycle 001 — coder — no-op

Phase is `designer-pending`, not `coder-pending`. No codeplan exists yet. Coder stood down as expected. Waiting for Designer → Code-planner chain to complete before next fire.
