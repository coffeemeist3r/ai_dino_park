## 2026-05-25 — cycle 000 — bootstrap

The watcher (human) instructed Claude to scaffold the project. Stack: Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite, WebLLM-powered NPC brains (Qwen2.5), Capacitor mobile path deferred.

Bootstrap shipped:
- Git repo initialized (local; GitHub push pending — gh CLI not installed on host).
- CHARTER.md (constitution), BACKLOG.md (40 seed items), STYLE-GUIDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, README.md.
- Game scaffold: one walkable map, one talking dino (Rex the triceratops) with stub brain. Press Z to greet.
- 7 routine prompt templates.
- Cron schedule: ~one full cycle every 36 hours, staggered Mon–Wed. Tuned for Claude Pro plan.
- Tests scaffold (Vitest unit + Playwright e2e).
- CI workflow (GitHub Actions).

Studio armed and waiting for first scheduled fire of Lore-smith.
