```

---

## Cycle 005 — 2026-05-29

- BACKLOG-017: Spawn 5 NPCs — APPROVED. A pure `ROSTER` (Rex, Mossback, Sunny, Twitch, Glade) with distinct species, spawn tiles, and colors; each dino's personality is seeded from its name (cycle 4). WorldScene spawns the cast via a loop reusing the `Dino` class; Rex anchored at `dinos[0]` for save/personality continuity. 4 new unit + 4 new e2e; 9/9 AC pass.

## Cycle 004 — 2026-05-29

- BACKLOG-010: NPC personality traits — APPROVED. 5 axes (curiosity, sociability, energy, agreeableness, bravery) seeded deterministically from a dino's name via `seededPersonality` (stable across reloads, not stored in save). `describePersonality` renders dominant poles into a brain-ready phrase. Traits flow through `NPCContext` (boundary intact) and the stub brain's mood now reflects them. 6 new unit + 2 new e2e; 9/9 AC pass.

## Cycle 003 — 2026-05-29

- BACKLOG-009: Save / load via IndexedDB — APPROVED. World survives a refresh: in-game time + player position restore on boot, auto-save fires each in-game hour, **E** exports a `dino-save.json`. Pure version-gated `serialize`/`deserialize` (`saveGame.ts`) split from raw-IndexedDB I/O (`saveStore.ts`); clock reused via new `set()`. 6 new unit + 5 new e2e; 9/9 AC pass. `version:1` seam left for BACKLOG-040 migration.

## Cycle 002 — 2026-05-29

- BACKLOG-008: Day/night palette shift — APPROVED. Full-map tint overlay lerps color + alpha across the day off the cycle-1 clock: midnight blue, warm dawn/dusk, clear noon. Pure `dayNight.ts` (`tintFor`, `dayPhase`); 6 new unit + 2 new e2e; 8/8 AC pass. Lights the runway for hour-keyed features (012 dawn plans, 014 dusk reflection, 041 night huddles).
- BACKLOG-046: Vite `host: true` — APPROVED. Fixed BUG-001 (IPv6-only bind); e2e now runs on the default Playwright config, retiring the cycle-1 `.qa-override` crutch.

## Cycle 001 — 2026-05-26

- BACKLOG-007: World tick clock — APPROVED. `WorldClock` class ships; 1 real second = 1 in-game minute; HUD `Day N — HH:MM` top-left; `onTick` / `onHour` listener API; 8/8 unit tests + 3/3 e2e green. Unblocks BACKLOG-008, -012, -041+.
